# Teaching

I try to gather informations about what I teach or taught. The pages are all in
French.

## 2020 -- 2021

Since September 2020, I teach for the mathematics department of Université de
Versailles and I am an oral examiner in maths for students in
[CPGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles)
in [Lycée Robert Doisneau](/teaching/colles/doisneau) and lycée du
[Parc des Loges](/teaching/colles/parcdesloges).

## 2017 -- 2020

I was "moniteur" at Université de Versailles during my PhD
thesis. I taught cryptography for third-year students (L3) and first-year
students in master's degree (M1), as well as an introduction to programming for
first-year students (L1).
