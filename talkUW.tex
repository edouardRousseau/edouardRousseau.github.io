\section{\scshape Introduction}
\subsection{The discrete logarithm problem}
\begin{frame}{Context}
  Let $G$ be a cyclic group generated by an element $g$, we denote by $N$ the
  cardinal of $G$. Then we have a \emph{bijection}
  \[
    \begin{array}{cccc}
      exp_g: & \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z} & \to & G \\
      & \bar n & \mapsto & g^n
    \end{array}.
  \]

  The inverse of $exp_g$ will be denoted by $log_g$. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The discrete logarithm problem}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In practice, given an iteger $n$, we have efficient algorithms
      to compute $g^n$
    \item Given $x = g^n \in G$, we \emph{do not} hace efficient algorithm
      to compute $n$.
  \end{itemize}
  This last problem is called the \emph{discrete logarithm problem}.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{frame}{Definitions}
  To express the hardness of a problem, we study its complexity and we use the
  notation
  \[
    L_N(\alpha, c) = \exp((c+o(1))(\log N)^\alpha(\log\log N)^{1-\alpha}).
  \]
  We also note $L_N(\alpha)$ when we do not want to deal with the constant.

  There are two families of algorithms :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{generic} algorithms (with complexity $O(\sqrt N)$)
    \item The \emph{index calculus} alorithms, which use the structure
      of groups coming from finite fields : $\mathbb{F}_{q}^\times$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definitions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We say that a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q=\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ is of
      \emph{small characteristic} when $p$ is small compared to $q$, it usually
      means that $p$ is polynomial in $\log q$.
    \item Let $l = \log q$, the complexity is then said to be
      \emph{quasi-polynomial} if it is
  $l^{O(\log l)}$. This complexity is smaller that $L(\varepsilon)$ for any
  $\varepsilon>0$ but greater than any polynomial in $l$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Historical background}
\begin{frame}{Historical background}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First appearance in ``New directions in cryptography'' (Diffie, Hellman; 1976)
    \item First sub-exponential algorithm (Adleman; 1979) with complexity
      $L(1/2)$
  \item First algorithm in $L(1/3)$ in binary finite fields
    (Coppersmith; 1984)
  \item Number field sieve in prime fields in 1993,
    $L(1/3)$
  \item Function field sieve in small characteristic in 1994,
    generalisations in 1999, 2002, 2006; $L(1/3)$
  \item Generalisation of the number field sieve in 2006, every finite
    field is now covered by a $L(1/3)$ algorithm
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Historical background}
  And more recently, in finite fields of small characteristic :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item New algorithm with $L(1/4)$ complexity (Joux; 2013)
    \item \emph{Quasi-polynomial} algorithm (Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux, Thomé; 2014)
    \item Second quasi-polynomial algorithm (Granger, Kleinjung, Zumbrägel; 2014)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Index calculus}
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{frame}{Overview}
  Assume that we want to find $log_g(h)$ with $h\in G$. We fist choose $F\subset
  G$ such that $\left\langle F \right\rangle = G$. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We find multiplicative relations between the elements in $F$
    \item We solve the linear system arising from these relations
    \item We express $h$ as a product of elements in $F$
  \end{enumerate}
  The steps $1$ and $3$ depends on the representation of the finite field, and
  give different complexities.
\end{frame}

\subsection{An example}
\begin{frame}{An example}
  \emph{Context :}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We considere $G = \mathbb{F}_p^\times$ for a prime integer $p$ and we
      still have $N = |G|$
    \item We choose $F = \left\{\, f \;|\; f \leq B,\; f \text{ prime}
    \right\}$ for a chosen integer $B$
  \item We assume that $g\in F$, otherwise we add it to $F$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An example}
  \emph{Step 1 : relations generation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We randomly choose $e\in \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$
    \item We compute $g^e$
    \item We test if $g^e$, seen as an integer, is $B$-smooth, \ie has only
      prime factors $\leq B$
    \item If it is the case, it yields a relation in $G$ :
      \[ 
        g^e = \prod_{f\in F}f^{e_f}, \text{ où } e_f\in \mathbb{N}
      \]
      that can be written
      \[
        e = \sum_{f\in F}e_f\log_g(f).
      \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An example}
  \emph{Step 2 : linear algebra.} Once we have enough relations, \ie at least
  $|F|$, we solve the linear system in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ in order to
  obtain the $\log_g(f)$ for all $f\in F$.
  
  \emph{Step 3 : express $h$ in function of the elements in $F$ :}
  \begin{itemize}
     \item We randomly choose $e\in \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$
    \item We compute $hg^e$
    \item We test if $hg^e$ is $B$-smooth
    \item If it is the case, it yields a relation  :
     \[
      \log_g(h) = \sum_{f\in F}e_f\log_g(f) - e
      \]
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An example}
  This algorithm depends on the choice of $B$ :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The larger $B$ is, the larger $\left\langle F \right\rangle$ is, and
      the easier it is to find relations
    \item But when $|F|$ is large, we need to solve a large linear system
  \end{itemize}
  In the end, we can choose $B$ to obtain a $L(1/2)$ complexity.
\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Quasi-polynomial algorithms} 
\subsection{Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux and Thomé algorithm}

\begin{frame}{Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux et Thomé algorithm}
  We denote by $\mathbb{K}$ the finite field where we want to compute discrete
  logarithms.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We assume that $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{F}_{q^{2k}}$ and we represent
      $\mathbb{K}$ by $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X]/(I_X)$ where $I_X$ is an irreducible
      polynomial of degree $k$ dividing $h_1X^q-h_0$ and $\deg h_i\leq 2$.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The existence of suitable $h_i$ is heuristic
      \end{itemize}
    \item The set $F$ is the set of the degree one polynomials.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm is based on a descent process: we express the logarithm of a
polynomial in function of $O(q^2k)$ logarithms of polynomials of degree two
times smaller, until we have only polynomials in $F$.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Complexity : $(q^2k)^{O(\log k)}$.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The descent}
  We will use the \emph{systematic equation}
 \[
   X^q - X = \prod_{a\in\mathbb{F}_q}(X-a)
 \]
 that we transform in
 \begin{equation}
   X^qY - XY^q = \prod_{(\alpha, \beta)\in\mathcal S}(\beta X - \alpha Y)
   \label{keyeq}
 \end{equation}
 where $\mathcal S$ is a set of representatives of the $q+1$ points of the
 projective line $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_q)$ chosen such that the equality
 (\ref{keyeq}) is true.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The descent}
  Assume that we want to find the logarithm of an element $P$. We will create
  relations by substituting $X$ by $aP + b$ and $Y$ by $cP + d$ in Equation
  (\ref{keyeq}), with $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We obtain a new
  Equation $(E_{a, b, c, d})$. It follows that
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{1}{h_1^D}\mathcal L_{a, b, c, d} &=& \lambda \prod_{(\alpha, \beta)\in\mathcal S}(P-\mu_{\alpha, \beta})
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $\lambda, \mu_{\alpha, \beta}\in\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ and $\mathcal L_{a, b, c,
  d}$ is a polynomial of degree $D\leq 3\deg P$, obtained using the equality $X^q =
  \frac{h_0}{h_1}\mod I_X$.
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The descent}
  We keep only the equations $(E_{a, b, c, d})$ where
  $\mathcal L_{a, b, c, d}$ is
  $\left\lceil \frac{\deg P}{2}\right\rceil$-smooth and we combine these equations
  in order to keep only $P$ in the right hand side.

  The left hand side is then composed of polynomials $\mathcal L_{a, b, c, d}$
  of degree at most $\left\lceil \frac{\deg P}{2}\right\rceil$.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are also heuristics
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The existence of the combination
        \item The smoothness of the polynomials $\mathcal L_{a, b, c, d}$
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Granger, Kleinjung and Zumbrägel algorithme}

\begin{frame}{Granger, Kleinjung and Zumbrägel algorithm}
  Here $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{F}_{q^k}$ and we see $\mathbb{K}$ as
  $\mathbb{F}_q[X]/(I_X)$ where $I_X$ is a polynomial of degree $k$ dividing
  $h_1X^q-h_0$. The algorithm follows the same steps as the latter, but the
  descent is different.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{``On the fly'' elimination}
  Assume that $Q\in \mathbb{F}_{q^m}[X]$ and $\deg Q = 2$. This elimination is
  based on the fact that the polynomial $P = X^{q+1}+aX^q+bX+c$ splits completly
  in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}[X]$ for approximately $q^{m-3}$ triplets $(a, b, c)$. But
  
  \[
    P = \frac{1}{h_1}((X+a)h_0 + (bX+c)h_1)\mod I_X
  \]
  So if $Q| (X+a)h_0 + (bX+c)h_1$ (polynomial of degree $3$), we have 
  \[
    h_1P=QL \mod I_X
  \]
  where $L$ is of degree $1$ and $P$ splits completly.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The descent}
  Assume now that $Q\in\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]$ is irreducible of degree $2d$. Then we
  have
  \[
    Q=\prod_{i=1}^d Q_i
  \]
  where the $Q_i$'s are irreducible polynomial of degree $2$ in
  $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}[X]$ and are all conjugates. We then apply the ``on the fly''
  elimination to $Q_1$ to obtain $\log Q_1$ as a linear combination of 
  $O(q)$ $\log P_i$ where the $P_i\in \mathbb{F}_{q^d}[X]$ are all of degree $1$.
  
  Recall that the norm of a linear polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}[X]$ is an irreducible
  polynomial of degree $d_1$ to the power $d_2$, with $d_1d_2 = d$.
  \emph{Thus, we expressed $\log Q$ as a linear combination of $O(q)$ $\log
  R_i$ where $\deg R_i | d$.}
