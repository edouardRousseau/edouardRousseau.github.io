# Teaching

I try to gather informations about what I teach or taught. Be careful, the material might be in French.

## 2017 -- 2018

I taught cryptography at two different levels in Université de Versailles. I
gave a few hours in M1 and some more in L3, the student were all in computer
science. You can the exercices [here](crypto-l3) (L3) and [there](crypto-m1)
(M1). 

## 2016 -- 2017

I was an oral examiner in maths for second-year students in biology ([BCPST2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_préparatoire_aux_grandes_écoles#Scientific_CPGE)) in
the French system
[CPGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles). You can find the exercices [here](colles).

## 2013 -- 2014

I was a tutor for first-year student in physics
