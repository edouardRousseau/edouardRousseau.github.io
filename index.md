### About me

Hi, I am Édouard, a master student in computer algebra at *Université de
Versailles*. I am interested in almost everything related to mathematics,
computer science, and teaching. My main domain of interest are computer algebra,
finite fields, field extensions, coding theory, and cryptography. On top of
that, I like to spread the idea of free software and free licenses in general.

If you want to know more, you can send me an e-mail or look at the curriculum
vitæ section.

### Teaching

I teach in the french system
[CPGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles), you can look at it the teaching section (in french).
