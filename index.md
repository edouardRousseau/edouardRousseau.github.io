This site is mostly experimental, the real goal is just to share exercices
with students.

## What I like

Hi, I am Édouard, a master student in applied algebra at *Université de
Versailles*. I am curious about almost everything related to mathematics,
computer science, and teaching. My main domains of interest are computer algebra,
finite fields, coding theory, and cryptography. On top of
that, I like to spread the idea of free software and free licenses in general.

If you want to know more, you can send me an
[e-mail](mailto:edouard.rousseau@u-psud.fr) !

## Teaching

I try to gather informations about what I teach, or used to teach, in the [dedicated section](teaching). Be carefull, it might be in French.
